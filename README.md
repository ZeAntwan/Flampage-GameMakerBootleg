# Flampage Gamemaker Project
First ever gameproject I did as part of my studies at Enjmin.

While the full project was being developped in Unity, I didn't want to mess with the programmers work, so I started a "bottleg" prototype to test my camera design in Gamemaker studio 2 (still in Beta at the time)

Time passes, and I keep adding the final assets into the prototype leading to the same game... On a different engine, and closer to my design.
